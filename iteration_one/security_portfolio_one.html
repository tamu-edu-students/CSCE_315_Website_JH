    SECURITY PORTFOLIO

<div id="hackthebox">

    <p> I'm currently ranked at "hacker" on hackthebox, with 17 user flags captured, and 15 root flags captured. Most of
        my experience is with linux machines, although I have completed a few Windows machines as well. I've also completed
        11 challenges, most of which were OSINT related. </p>

<div id="python_backdoor">
    <img src="../media/vhl_page.png", width="750">
    <p> I've been trained by the VHL and have obtained root access to 30 of their lab machines, 20 of which were
        ranked as beginner and advanced, with the last 10 being in the "advanced +" category. I'm still waiting on the
        approval of my writeup for the official certification, though. </p>

<div id="cap_program">
    <img src="../media/cap_page.png", width="750">
    <p> I'm employed as a student security analyst at A&M through the CAP program. I spend most of my time threat
        hunting on A&M's network, or responding to security incidents. It's been a great job, I've learned a lot from my
        experiences in the program.</p>
