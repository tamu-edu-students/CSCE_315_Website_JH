            HACKTHEBOX EXPERIENCE
        </h3>
        <img src="../../media/hackthebox_profile.png" width="750" height="400">
        <p> I'm currently ranked at "hacker" on hackthebox, with 17 user flags captured, and 15 root flags captured.
            Most of
            my experience is with linux machines, although I have completed a few Windows machines as well. I've also
            completed
            11 challenges, most of which were OSINT related. <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/356903">

            WORK EXPERIENCE
        </h4>
        <img src="../../media/cap_page.png" width="750" height="400">
        <p> I'm employed as a student security analyst at A&M through the CAP program. I spend most of my time threat
            hunting on A&M's network, or responding to security incidents. It's been a great job, I've obtained
            experience with industry standard tools, and cybersecurity in an enterprise environment.
