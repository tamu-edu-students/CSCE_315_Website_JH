            I used to be a boy scout, and in my time as a scout I would frequently participate in fundraisers for the
            church my troop met at. This often consisted of things like car washes, lawn work, or other labor to raise
            money for the church. During this time I also participated in yearly events with
            <a href="https://missionarlington.org/">"Mission Arlington"</a>,
            working as a food processor / packer in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving to provide the homeless with
            food for Thanksgiving.

            I also hope to begin mentoring younger students in <a href="https://cybr.club/">A&M's cybersecurity club</a>
            , as I've gained enough
            experience to help them learn. I'm also working on a website that will standardize the training for
            student security analysts with some of my coworkers. This involves me writing programs and scripts
            along with thorough explanations to help the reader comprehend and benefit from the training.
