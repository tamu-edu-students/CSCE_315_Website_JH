            My name is Joshua Hillis, I'm an aspiring information security professional studying computer science at Texas A&M
            University! Although I’m studying computer science, I spend the majority of my free time in the cybersecurity space,
            whether that be development or actively learning, participating in competitions, or anything in between.
            I am active on HackTheBox, as I like using that website and the services it provides to hone my skills, apply
            my knowledge, and learn new things. I also compete in cybersecurity competitions such as the NCL, and will be competing
            in Cyberforce later this year. I work as a student security analyst for A&M, and also have a concentration in
            cybersecurity for my degree plan. I hope to eventually become a red team operator once I’ve gotten some more
            experience in industry, but enjoy working on most things that are security related in one way or another. For more
            information, please check out my security portfolio!
