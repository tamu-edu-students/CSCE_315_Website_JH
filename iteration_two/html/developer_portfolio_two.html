    <p> I created a python program that interacts with coinbase pro to automatically trade ethereum. It uses the
        coinbase pro API to pull live data and historical data, analyze the data with technical analysis, and automatically
        places buy and sell orders. Although I don't have enough faith in it to use real money with it, I've consistently
        been able to achieve 10% profits when back testing over historical data.</p>

    <p> I created a simple remote access tool with python. It opens up a hidden connection to a command and control
        server I have running on a raspberry pi, although for this example I simply ran both of the scripts on my own
        machine. It was a fun exercise, and helped me learn how to hide processes and programs.</p>
