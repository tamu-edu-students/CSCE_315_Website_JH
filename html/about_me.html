            My name is Joshua Hillis, I'm an aspiring information security professional studying computer science at
            Texas A&M University! Although I’m studying computer science, I spend the majority of my free time in the
            cybersecurity space, whether that be development or actively learning, participating in competitions, or
            anything in between.
            I am active on HackTheBox, as I like using that website and the services it provides to hone my skills,
            apply
            my knowledge, and learn new things. I also compete in cybersecurity competitions such as the
            <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">NCL</a>, and will be competing in
            <a href="https://cyberforce.energy.gov/">CyberForce</a> later this year.
            I work as a student security analyst for A&M, and also have a concentration in cybersecurity for my degree
            plan. I hope to eventually become a red team operator once I’ve gotten some more experience in industry,
            but enjoy working on most things that are security related in one way or another. For more information,
            please check out my security portfolio!

            Other than that, I’m a big fan of most combat sports, and used to practice martial arts in my spare time.
            Mixed
            Martial Arts, Muay Thai, Boxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling are all very exciting for me to watch. I
            briefly
            ran as part of the cross country team, but quickly decided that sport was not for me. I also enjoy watching
            movies
            and listening to music. My favorite movie is Blade Runner, and I'm a big fan of punk rock and spend the
            majority of
            my time listening to bands such as Rise Against, Green Day, and Black Flag. I also greatly enjoy drawing,
            although
            I don’t think most of the drawings and doodles I have would reflect the time I spend drawing, but it’s fun
            to do
            nonetheless. I’m certified in both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate, and used to create short animations in
            my free
            time as well.
