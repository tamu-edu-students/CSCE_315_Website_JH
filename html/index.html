    Hi, my name is Joshua Hillis. I'm currently a junior at Texas A&M University, studying computer science with a
    concentration in cybersecurity. I spend the majority of my time in the cybersecurity space, competing in CTF
    competitions, working as a student security analyst at A&M, and studying new exploits and industry trends. I'm always
    eager to learn, and ready for new challenges!
