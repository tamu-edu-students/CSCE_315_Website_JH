        <p> I created a python program that interacts with coinbase pro to automatically trade ethereum. It uses the
            coinbase pro API to pull live data and historical data, analyze the data with technical analysis, and
            automatically
            places buy and sell orders. Although I don't have enough faith in it to use real money with it, I've
            consistently
            been able to achieve 10% profits when back testing over historical data.

        <p> I created a simple remote access tool with python. It opens up a hidden connection to a command and control
            server I have running on a raspberry pi, although for this example I simply ran both of the scripts on my
            own
            machine. It was a fun exercise, and helped me learn how to hide processes and programs on Windows machines,
            as well as teaching me about networking.
