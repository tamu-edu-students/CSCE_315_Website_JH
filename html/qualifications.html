            Although I'm pursuing a degree in computer science, my technical areas of interest are almost all
            cybersecurity related. I like identifying vulnerabilities in systems and creating exploits, since most
            vulnerabilities differ from others enough to make it a creative process with different requirements every
            time. I really enjoy being able to take broad knowledge of computer systems and programs and find unique
            and interesting ways to apply that knowledge to break a system, or bypass its security. Other than security,
            I'm also quite interesting in artificial intelligence and machine learning, although I haven't found the
            courage to tinker with those yet.
        </p>
        <p id="p_2">
            As you can see in the resume, most of my technical skills are offensive security related. I have lots of
            experience exploiting web applications by exploiting technologies such as Python, Flask, Jinja, SQL, and
            more. I have experience with Wi-Fi and bluetooth hacking, creating malware for Windows systems, and I'm
            proficient with linux environments. I'm also proficient with many tools used for offensive security, such
            as
            <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>,
            <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark </a>, Burpsuite, and more.
        </p>
        <p id="p_3">
            I also have lots of experience using tools like Splunk, Crowdstrike, Extrahop, and more in an enterprise
            environment. I'm a proficient threat hunter, and have experience patching, securing, and hardening many
            types of systems. I'm good at working in team environments, and possess a security oriented mindset for
            both defensive and offensive operations.
