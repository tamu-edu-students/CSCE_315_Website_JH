        I used to be a boy scout, and in my time as a scout I would frequently participate in fundraisers for the
        church my troop met at. This often consisted of things like car washes, lawn work, or other labor to raise
        money for the church. During this time I also participated in yearly events with
        <a href="https://missionarlington.org/">"Mission Arlington"</a>,
        working as a food processor / packer in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving to provide the homeless with
        food for Thanksgiving.

        I also hope to begin mentoring younger students in <a href="https://cybr.club/">A&M's cybersecurity club</a>
        , as I've gained enough
        experience to help them learn. I'm also working on a website that will standardize the training for
        student security analysts with some of my coworkers. This involves me writing programs and scripts
        along with thorough explanations to help the reader comprehend and benefit from the training.
